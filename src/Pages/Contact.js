            I have always been interested by design, the digital market and the
            tech industry, but I am open to many other fields. I keep my skills
            up to date and try to create attractive and creative projects. As
            much as I can If you have a project in mind and would like to share
            it with me, feel free to contact me. I would be pleased to
            collaborate with awesome people.{" "}
